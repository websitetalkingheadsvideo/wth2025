			<h2>Player Features</h2>
			<dt>How it Plays</dt>
			<dd> You can choose from several autostart features including; Auto Play, Click-to-Play, Click-for-Audio, Play Once then Click-to-Play, Loop and more. </dd>
			<dt>When it Plays</dt>
			<dd> You can add a delay before your video starts or playing your video can be triggered by an event on screen. </dd>
			<dt>Location and Placement</dt>
			<dd> Any location on the screen both on the page or off.</dd>
			<dt>Responsive</dt>
			<dd>With the rise of responsive websites we have added the ability to place our player inside a specific div tag. If you set the responsive variable to "yes" you can then place the player's div tag inside of the div you would like the video to play in. This will place the video inside of that tag, wherever it is on the page.</dd>
			<dt>Fixed or Absolute Positioning</dt>
			<dd>This can be set to either "fixed" or "absolute". Fixed positioning means that the video will stay in the same place with respect to the browser window while the user is scrolling up and down. Absolute fixes your video to the webpage and it will scroll up with the webpage as the user scrolls down.</dd>
			<dt>Volume</dt>
			<dd> Turn it up or Turn it Down. </dd>
			<dt>Control Bar Color</dt>
			<dd> Change the color of the Flash control bar to match your website. </dd>

			<dd> You can completely change the Play button of the Flash player or any of the buttons on the HTML5 player to any image you want. </dd>
