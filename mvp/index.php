        <p>It is called this for a reason. Why give your customers the same message everytime they visit? It might get boring, right. We have been offering this player for almost 2 years. If a video will influence a customer the first time then why not give them a slightly different message that builds on the previous video's message?</p>
        <p>If you look at your analytics, I bet you will see that your visitors don't buy the first time they visit your website. For many websites it happens on the 5th, 6th, or 7th visit. What if you could speed that up a bit?</p>

    <p> What if by using the right message each time you could get them to buy 2 or 3 visits sooner? And what if by doing that you also got more visitors to buy? That is why this player is a MUST. Talk to your project manager today and together you can determine the right number of videos per page makes sense for you.</p>
