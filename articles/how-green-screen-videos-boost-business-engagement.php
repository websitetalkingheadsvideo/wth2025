      <p class="lead">Green screen video production has transformed how brands connect with audiences online. Whether you're a startup or an established company, integrating a green screen spokesperson on your website can dramatically increase engagement and credibility.</p>
      
      <h2>🎥 Why Use Green Screen in Business Videos?</h2>
      <p>Green screen (also known as chroma key) allows for versatile backgrounds that match your brand's style, whether it's a sleek office look or a vibrant animation. This flexibility keeps your videos visually consistent and professionally branded, no matter where they appear on your site.</p>
      
      <h2>👔 Professional Presentation, Every Time</h2>
      <p>When combined with a video spokesperson, green screen enhances communication. Instead of plain text or static graphics, a real human face delivers your message, creating instant trust and a more personal user experience.</p>
      
      <p>According to a study by Wyzowl, 86% of businesses use video as a marketing tool, and most say it improves lead generation and conversion. With green screen production, the results are even more polished — ensuring visitors stay longer and take action.</p>
      
      <h2>🌟 Perfect for Product Demos, Training, and Sales</h2>
      <p>Green screen video is ideal for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Product demonstrations</li>
        <li>Website welcome videos</li>
