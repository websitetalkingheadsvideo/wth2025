## Depth Evaluation

**Exploration Summary:**
- **Tier 1**: 1 unique URL discovered
- **Tier 2**: 14 unique URLs discovered (including redirects)
- **Tier 3**: 50+ unique URLs discovered from Tier 2 pages
- **Tier 4**: 1 unique URL discovered from Tier 3 pages

**Stopping Rationale:**
Exploration was stopped at Tier 4 because:
1. Most Tier 3 pages primarily link back to Tier 1 and Tier 2 pages (navigation consistency)
2. The site structure follows a clear hierarchy: Home → Main Sections → Sub-sections → Deep content
3. Further tiers would primarily reveal:
   - Pagination links (support/?ref=pagination&page=X)
   - Query parameter variations of existing pages
   - External links (social media, third-party services)
   - Asset files (images, CSS, JavaScript) rather than content pages
4. The sitemap.php page provides a comprehensive listing of all major content pages, which have been captured in Tiers 1-3

**Key Findings:**
- Strong internal linking structure with consistent navigation across all pages
- Main content areas: Spokespeople, Order Forms, Whiteboard Videos, Video Presentations, Contact, Specials
- Multiple specialty player pages and feature pages for specific video solutions
- Support section with pagination (indicated by sitemap references)
- Style showcase pages for different video production types
- Legacy and specialty pages (MVP players, jumper, fidget, random player)

**Note on Counts:**
The count in parentheses represents the number of times each URL was discovered across all tiers during exploration. URLs appearing in navigation menus will have higher counts as they appear on multiple pages.
