      <p class="card-text">With the Talking Heads&reg; Special you get to choose from one of two professional spokespeople. There are three major factors to consider:</p>
      <dl class="dl-card">
        <dt>What should your spokesperson look like?</dt>
        <dd>There are many factors that go into choosing a good spokesperson for your company. One of these factors is their appearance. Who would you trust more, an unkempt man or woman in a suit or someone who looks like they take care of themselves? Appearance says a lot about someone, so it's important to choose someone with a good image for your company.</dd>
        <dt>What should your spokesperson sound like?</dt>
        <dd>For many, the idea of a spokesperson conjures up images of a charismatic and eloquent individual who delivers their message with conviction. The transparent video technology allows viewers to see the person behind the talking head and know that they are listening to a real person's voice.</dd>
        <dt>What does a Talking Heads Spokesperson Special cost?</dt>
        <dd>A Talking Heads Spokesperson Special is a transparent video with a human spokesperson. The price depends on how many videos are needed and the length of your script. See the above price list.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p class="card-text">A website spokesperson is a digital representation of your brand.  They speak for or represent a company, organization, or institution. They are often used in advertising and other public relations. They can be used for a variety of purposes, the most common being to create a sense of trust and credibility for your company.</p>
