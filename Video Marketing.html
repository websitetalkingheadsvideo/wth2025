<h3>{Think|Believe} in Audiences Not Markets</h3>
<p>{{What|Exactly what}'s your market? {Hire|Employ|Work with} {a consultant|a specialist|an expert} {to help|to assist} you with your Web-business {problems|issues} and {one of|among} the {first|very first} {questions|concerns} {he or she|she or he} will ask is, {what|exactly what}'s your market? How about eighteen to thirty-four {year old|years of age}, single male college graduates with {a dog|a canine|a pet dog|a pet} {named|called} Spot; or {maybe|perhaps|possibly} forty-five to fifty-nine {year old|years of age} {married women|wives}, who {hate|dislike} their {husbands|hubbies|spouses|other halves|partners} and {can't|cannot} get their adult {children|kids} to {move out of|vacate} {the house|your home|your house}. {Maybe|Perhaps|Possibly}, {just|simply} {maybe|perhaps|possibly}, they're asking the {wrong|incorrect} {question|concern}.|{Hire|Employ|Work with} {a consultant|a specialist|an expert} to {help|assist} you with your Web-business {problems|issues} and one of the {first|very first} {questions|concerns} he or she will ask is, {what|exactly what}'s your market?

<p>The Web {isn't|isn't really} about markets it's about audiences. Audiences {need to|have to} be {entertained|captivated|amused}, {enlightened|informed}, and engaged, and if your {website|site} {doesn't|does not}, you're {never|never ever} going to {achieve|accomplish|attain} {what|exactly what} you {want|desire}.</p>
<p>Time to {rethink|reconsider|reassess} how you're {delivering|providing} your marketing message. Start {treating|dealing with} Web-visitors like an audience not a market, and you {might|may} {just|simply} {find|discover} {what|exactly what} it {takes to be|requires} {successful|effective} {on the Web|online|on the internet}.</p>

<p>{Customers|Clients|Consumers} are {always|constantly} {looking for|searching for|trying to find} {a deal|an offer} and they're {leery|wary|hesitant} of {websites|sites} that {only|just} {want to|wish to} take their {hard|difficult|tough} {earned|made} {cash|money}.

<h3>{Think|Believe} in Experiences Not Features</h3>
<p>{Bought|Purchased} any {good|great|excellent} {features|functions} {lately|recently}? Didn't {think|believe} so.

<p>What {people|individuals} {really|truly|actually} {buy|purchase} are experiences, {hopefully|ideally} positives ones. Whether it's soft ice cream or {a new|a brand-new} accounting program, what {people|individuals} are {paying for|spending for} is the experience your {product or service|services or product|service or product|product and services} {provides|offers|supplies}.</p>
<p>Does your {website|site} {offer|provide|use} an experience? Does it {explain|discuss|describe} the experience your {product or service|services or product|service or product|product and services} {delivers|provides}? {If it {doesn't|does not}, then you {really|truly|actually} {haven't|have not} got anything {anybody|anyone|any person} {wants|desires}.|You {really|truly|actually} {haven't|have not} got anything {anybody|anyone|any person} {wants|desires} if it {doesn't|does not}.}</p>

<p>{Most|Many|A lot of|The majority of} animals {live in|reside in} the {moment|minute}, whereas {human beings|humans|people} live in the past. Our here and now and our {plans for|prepare for} the future are {based on|based upon} our experiences, our histories, and our memories.</p>
<p>We take {pictures of|photos of|images of} our kids, {holidays|vacations}, and {special|unique} {events|occasions}; we {commemorate|celebrate|honor} birthdays, anniversaries, {promotions|promos}, and {milestones|turning points} of all kinds. Even the significance of our {prized|valued|treasured} {possessions|belongings|ownerships} is {centered on|fixated} {the fact that|that} those {mere|simple} {objects|items|things} represent memories of {the people|individuals}, {places|locations}, and {events|occasions} that {shaped|formed} our lives.</p>
<p>{Real|Genuine} marketing, the kind that {creates|produces|develops} {long-term|long-lasting} {clients|customers} and {customer|client|consumer} relationships, is not about {coupons|discount coupons|vouchers}, sale {promotions|promos}, or deep {discounts|discount rates}; it's about {delivering|providing} memories.</p>

If visitors {remain|stay} on your {site|website} {long enough|enough time} {to get|to obtain} your marketing message then you {must|should|need to} have {said|stated} something worth {listening to|paying attention to}, and if visitors get the message, your {site|website} {has|has actually} done its {job|task}.</p>
