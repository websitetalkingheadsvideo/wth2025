description: Canonical header and footer files for Website Talking Heads site structure
globs: "**/*.php"
alwaysApply: true
---

- **Exclusions**
  - Files in the `whiteboard/` directory are EXCLUDED from this rule
  - Pages in `whiteboard/` may use different header/footer files as needed
  - Do not enforce canonical header/footer on files matching `whiteboard/**/*.php`

- **Canonical Header File**
  - The canonical header file is `includes/header25.php`
  - All pages MUST use `header25.php` for the site header
  - Do NOT use `header2.php`, `header19.php`, `header_b4.php`, or any other header files
  - Reference: [header25.php](mdc:includes/header25.php)

- **Canonical Footer File**
  - The canonical footer file is `includes/footer25.php`
  - All pages MUST use `footer25.php` for the site footer
  - Do NOT use `footer.php`, `footer2.php`, `footer_b4.php`, or any other footer files
  - Reference: [footer25.php](mdc:includes/footer25.php)

- **Usage Pattern**
  - Include header: `<?php include('includes/header25.php'); ?>` (adjust path for subdirectories)
  - Include footer: `<?php include('includes/footer25.php'); ?>` (adjust path for subdirectories)
  - Path examples:
    - Root level: `includes/header25.php`
    - One level deep: `../includes/header25.php`
    - Two levels deep: `../../includes/header25.php`

- **Migration**
  - When updating existing pages, replace any references to:
    - `header2.php` → `header25.php`
    - `header19.php` → `header25.php`
    - `header_b4.php` → `header25.php`
    - `footer.php` → `footer25.php`
    - `footer2.php` → `footer25.php`
    - `footer_b4.php` → `footer25.php`

- **Enforcement**
  - All new pages MUST use the canonical header and footer files
  - When fixing broken includes, always use the canonical files
  - Do not create new header or footer variations without explicit approval
