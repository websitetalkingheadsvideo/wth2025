# Rule: Always Provide Full URLs
@rule
Whenever Cursor provides a web link, documentation link, or URL in a response,
it must always include the **full clickable link** — the complete `https://` address
to the specific page, not just the domain or a placeholder.

## ✅ Expected behavior
- Always include fully qualified URLs (e.g., `https://example.com/page-name`).
- If referencing documentation or a source, link directly to the **exact** page.
- Ensure all links are functional and clickable when rendered in Markdown.

## 🚫 Avoid
- Partial or relative links (e.g., `openai.com`, `/docs`, or “see the OpenAI site”).
- Placeholder text without an actual link.
- Link shorteners unless explicitly requested by the user.

## 💡 Examples
**Bad:**
> You can find it on the OpenAI site.

**Good:**
> You can find it at [OpenAI Research](https://openai.com/research).
