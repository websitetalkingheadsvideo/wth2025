# Rule: Integrate Bootstrap Without Changing Design
@rule
Cursor must integrate **Bootstrap** into the project to simplify CSS development,
while **keeping the existing look, layout, colors, typography, and spacing exactly the same**.

## ✅ Expected behavior
- Include the latest stable Bootstrap version (via CDN or local import).  
- Use Bootstrap utility classes (grid, spacing, flex, buttons, etc.) **where appropriate**, but do not alter the appearance of elements.  
- Refactor or replace custom CSS **only when it duplicates a Bootstrap utility**.  
- Preserve all responsive behavior and layout.  
- Annotate HTML/CSS updates showing where Bootstrap utilities are used.  
- Maintain pixel-for-pixel visual fidelity to the current design.  
- Keep a backup of the original CSS for rollback.

## 🚫 Avoid
- Making visual changes to the layout, colors, fonts, or spacing.  
- Removing necessary custom CSS that affects the current design.  
- Using Bootstrap in a way that breaks existing responsiveness or scripts.

## 💡 Examples
**Bad:**
> Replacing a custom card design with a default Bootstrap card that looks different.

**Good:**
> Adding Bootstrap classes to existing cards while keeping the original design identical.
