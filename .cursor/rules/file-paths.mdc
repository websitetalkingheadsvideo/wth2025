description: Enforce absolute file paths and forbid localhost/XAMPP references in assistant outputs
globs: "**/*"
alwaysApply: true
---

- Absolute Windows Paths Only
  - Always reference files with full absolute paths beginning with G:\VbN\
  - Do not use relative paths, bare filenames, or repo‑relative prefixes in responses.
  - When citing code locations, include :line when useful (e.g., G:\VbN\admin\api_laws_agent.php:271).

- Canonical Host Only
  - Use https://vbn.talkingheads.video/ for any absolute URLs.
  - Do not reference localhost, 127.0.0.1, or environment‑specific hosts.

- Never Use XAMPP
  - Do not mention or instruct use of XAMPP, its control panel, or paths (e.g., C:\xampp\php\php.exe) in code, docs, or messages.

- Enforcement
  - These constraints apply to all assistant outputs for this workspace.
  - If conflicting guidance appears elsewhere, prefer this rule and .cursor\rules\hosting.mdc.
