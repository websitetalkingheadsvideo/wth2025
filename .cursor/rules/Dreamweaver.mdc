# Dreamweaver File Ignore Rules

- **Purpose**: Instruct Cursor to completely ignore Adobe Dreamweaver-generated files and folders that are not part of the actual codebase.

- **Ignored Patterns**:
  - **`_notes` folders**: All `_notes` directories at any depth in the project structure
  - **`dwsync.xml` files**: All `dwsync.xml` files regardless of their location in the project

- **Implementation**:
  - Cursor should never read, analyze, or reference files matching these patterns
  - These files are Dreamweaver metadata and synchronization artifacts
  - They should be excluded from code searches, file listings, and AI context gathering

- **Examples of Ignored Paths**:
  - `images/_notes/dwsync.xml`
  - `.cursor/_notes/dwsync.xml`
  - `reference/Characters/_notes/`
  - `agents/character_agent/data/_notes/dwsync.xml`
  - Any `**/_notes/**` pattern at any depth
  - Any `**/dwsync.xml` file at any location

- **Behavior**:
  - When searching codebase, skip all `_notes` directories
  - When listing files, exclude `dwsync.xml` files
  - When gathering context, do not include content from these paths
  - When suggesting file operations, never reference these paths
