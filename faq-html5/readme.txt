Upload the files iamone.swf and faq.xml to the same directory of the page that you want the FAQ to play on. Index.html has a sample of the code that must be used to place the faq on your page. You must use the scripts that are in the <head> and you must use the onclick javascript commands in the links for each of the questions. Also, the flash must have an id of "iamone" in order for it to work. Your faq.xml file can be edited to change colors, fonts, sizes and background image.  Please call us at 801-748-2281 if you have any questions.
