    <h4><a href="choosing_a_video_spokesperson/">Choosing the Best Video Spokesperson for your Business</a></h4>
    <p>You’ve seen them before. These are the people who greet you and introduce a business’ services or products whenever you visit their website. A <a href="website-spokesperson/">video spokesperson</a>, also known as a virtual actor, is basically an online video of actors overlaid alongside a site’s content. Instead of reading plain text, which can get boring for some, these actors basically walk you through everything you need to know and keep your attention for much longer when compared to simple articles.</p>
    <p>Think of them as no different from the presenters you see on TV. Whether they’re relaying information, news updates, messages or trying to sell you a new product, their job is to hold your attention and convince you to give what they’re offering a try. Not an easy feat considering the short attention span that most people have! This is one of the reasons why <a href="choosing_a_video_spokesperson/index.php">choosing the right actor or actress</a> for the job is important.</p>
