# Website Talking Heads - Project Rules

## Project Context
- Legacy website (20+ years old) recently hacked and restored from mismatched backups
- Site URL: https://www.websitetalkingheads.com/
- Contains legacy code, deprecated patterns, and fragments from multiple development generations
- Need to rebuild with modern practices while maintaining functionality

## Development Principles
- Comments in English only
- Prefer functional programming over OOP
- Use OOP classes only for connectors and interfaces to external systems
- Write pure functions - only modify return values, never input parameters or global state
- Make minimal, focused changes
- Follow DRY, KISS, and YAGNI principles
- Use strict typing everywhere - function returns, variables, collections
- Check if logic already exists before writing new code
- Avoid untyped variables and generic types
- Never use default parameter values - make all parameters explicit
- Create proper type definitions for complex data structures

## Error Handling
- Always raise errors explicitly, never silently ignore them
- Use specific error types that clearly indicate what went wrong
- Avoid catch-all exception handlers that hide the root cause
- Error messages should be clear and actionable
- NO FALLBACKS: Never mask errors with fallback mechanisms
- Transparent debugging: Show exactly what went wrong and why
- Fix root causes, not symptoms

## Code Style
- Respect existing code style and patterns
- Suggest only minimal changes related to current dialog
- Change as few lines as possible while solving the problem
- Focus only on what user is asking for - no extra improvements
- Understand existing codebase before suggesting changes
